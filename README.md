# Linux Desktop Gremlins!

Basically [KurtVelasco's Desktop Gremlin](https://github.com/KurtVelasco/Desktop_Gremlin), but re-written in PySide + Qt6.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeb75510-9725-4f3a-a259-0959ddc22603

💥 Features 💥

- Works on both X11 (with picom) and Hyprland (with XWayland).
- Also works on Windows and MacOS (follow the manual installation guide).
- Interactive controls:
    - **Drag & Drop:** 🖱️ Click and drag your gremlins to move 'em.
    - **Walk**: ⌨️ Hover your mouse over the gremlins, then use W/A/S/D to make 'em skedaddle 💨💨.
    - **Secret Moves:** Right-click on different spots to play special animations 😎! It might be a headpat, a poke, or something even more special!
- Also, if you leave the gremlins lonely for so long, they will occasionally make more ✨noises✨ to annoy you 😈😈. Think of it as *"1 hour of silence occasionally broken up by Mambo"*.

> Note: The *"1 hour of silence occasionally broken up by Mambo"* feature can be turned off (if you are a chicken 🐔🐔). See [Customizations](./docs/05-customize.md).

# Some differences between this and KurtVelasco's Desktop Gremlins

This is not a strict 1:1 port, because I made some changes to the animation flow to better match my own preferences. I also created a few additional spritesheets; please feel free to use them if they're helpful.
